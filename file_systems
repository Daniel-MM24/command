File Systems

What are File Systems: FAT, FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS
A file system is essentially the way your computer organizes and manages data on a storage device. Think of it as the librarian of your digital world, keeping track of where everything is stored and how to find it quickly.   

How File Systems Work
Structure: They create a hierarchical structure of directories and files, similar to folders and documents on your desktop.   
Data Allocation: They determine how data is stored on the physical storage device (like a hard drive or SSD).   
Access Control: They manage permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific files or directories.   
Metadata: They store information about files, such as creation date, size, and type.

FAT (File Allocation Table)
Oldest file system.
Simple structure, easy to understand.   
Limited file size and partition size.   
Rarely used today.

FAT32
Successor to FAT.   
Improved file size and partition limits compared to FAT.   
Widely compatible with various operating systems and devices.   
Common for USB drives, SD cards, and external hard drives.

exFAT (Extended FAT)
Designed for flash drives and other removable media.   
Combines the simplicity of FAT32 with the larger file size and partition support of NTFS.
Better performance than FAT32 for large files.   
Wide compatibility, though not as universal as FAT32.

NTFS (New Technology File System)
Modern file system used by Windows.   
Advanced features like file permissions, encryption, and journaling.   
Supports large file sizes and partitions.   
Less compatible with other operating systems compared to FAT32 and exFAT.
